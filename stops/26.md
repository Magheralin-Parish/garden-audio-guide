### Background

In Jacob’s dream, he sees a ladder connecting heaven to earth with angels travelling up and down.  In the New Testament, Jesus explains that He has now become our stairway and our connection between earth and heaven. 

The ladder becomes a stairway… The dream becomes a reality… The path that only angels tread originally, now becomes an invitation that is open to all.

In the chancel area, the large white staircase represents Jesus as the stairway, leading us to God and the Kingdom of Heaven. Surrounded by candles and lanterns, we are reminded that Jesus is the light of the world.   The trees surrounding the stairway remind us of the tree of life in heaven.  

The world tries to tell us to work harder, to keep climbing the staircase and to struggle step after step.  But the Bible tells us that we only need to take one step on the stairway, one step to Jesus. Once we accept Jesus’ invitation to believe and trust in Him, we take the first step onto that stairway knowing He has done the rest.

“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6)
