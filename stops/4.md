#### *Featuring an interview with Mick Rogers*

### Background 

God is a God of wonder and a God of miracles.

 “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible...” (Colossians 1:16)

God’s angelic army is described in a multitude of forms – as chariots, stars, hosts, creatures and watchers.  They appear as heavenly creatures, visions of light, spiritual beings and, sometimes, as ordinary men. Hebrews 13:2 says,

“Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.”

While most angels are invisible in our daily lives, their presence and existence are often known, their touch felt and their voice heard. 

Here, the invisible angel is transitioning to visible - a being with temporary solid form and fashioned from ash wood.  The movement in the carving attempts to capture the moment an angel appears to us from the spiritual realm.  

The very nature of an angel challenges us to open our eyes and our hearts to the spiritual realm.  It calls us to gaze in wonder at the God who is far greater than the angels.
