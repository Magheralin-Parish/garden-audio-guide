### Background

The angels sang together in delight at the creation of the earth, and they joyfully announced the birth of Jesus.  The Bible offers us insights into angels’ expression of joy.

In Luke’s gospel, however, Jesus shares with us a more personal cause of rejoicing among the angelic hosts - a joyful celebration is triggered in heaven when we turn to God in faith, 

“…there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” (Luke 15:10)

Jesus allows us an insight into the joy of His angels.  Angels are deeply intrigued by God’s salvation and, are not able to experience salvation themselves.  Indeed, they “long to look” into it and long to have a greater understanding.  God’s salvation plan was purposed only to restore the brokenness of our relationship with God, and His holy angels cannot comprehend it.  They can only stand in joy, awe and wonder at God’s gift to the human race.

In the patchworked backdrop, the triangle angels dance across heaven in the full, colourful spectrum of the rainbow.  Closer to us, we focus on the three joyful angels captured in united celebration. 

As angels rejoice, so too does God.  The God of joy rejoices over His creation, His children and especially our salvation.
