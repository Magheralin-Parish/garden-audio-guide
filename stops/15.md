### Background

Amid the silence of the shepherds’ watch, on a Bethlehem hillside, comes the proclamation from the angel, 

“...behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10-11)

This story brings us one of the most well-known accounts of angel appearances in the Bible. The Christmas message was carried by the heavenly host of angels to the shepherds two thousand years ago. Today, to us, God proclaims His good news, His great joy and His abundant peace. 

Here we focus on one angel, but imagine a multitude.  

“And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!’” (Luke 2:13-14)

The shepherds’ angel, sculpted in preserved plant and branch materials, creates a rich rustic effect.  The traditional Christmas colours of green, red and gold call us to celebrate Christmas in the light of the good news brought by the angels.
