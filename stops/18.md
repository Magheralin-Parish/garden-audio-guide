### Background

No angels appear at the cross at Calvary. 

 “Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matthew 26:53)

The entire angel host await a command to rescue Jesus. But there is no angel rescue, no supernatural deliverance, no heavenly intervention.  Instead, Jesus chooses the cross, and dies to secure for us a path of salvation.

Do the angels look on from heaven? We suspect that they are forced to turn their backs and avert their eyes as the Son of God gives up His life for us. 

Here, the multifaceted wooden cross is comprised of horizontal and vertical layers of wood, reflecting patterns of light and darkness. They represent the strategic and divinely prearranged path to the cross that was prophesied in the Old Testament. 

A love so amazing… so divine... poured out for us on the cross.   God’s salvation plan is completed in the cross.
