### Background

Moses and the Israelites are journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land. In the form of a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, God guides Moses.  At the Red Sea, an angel acts as a protector standing between the Israelites and the approaching Egyptian army.
 
The God of faithfulness guides and guards Moses and the Israelites from beginning to end. Exodus 23:20 says,
 
“Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared.”
 
Our pillars, strong and visible set against a painted desert background, show that in the most desolate parts of our lives, we can see God.  The wilderness scene in the background can only be viewed through the angel pillars. Visually, we are reminded that, in our own lives, if we remain consumed by and focused on the intricate details of the wilderness, we may miss the faithful, protective presence of God that promises to guide us through each day and each night.
