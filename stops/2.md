### Background

Genesis tells us that angels have not always existed, but that the heavenly hosts were created before us.  While we are the pinnacle of God’s creation, for a time on earth we are made “a little lower than the angels”. (Psalm 8:5)

At creation the choir of angels praised, worshipped and shouted for joy as God carefully knitted and wove together the universe. Job 38:6-7 tells us that “The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy” when God laid the “cornerstone” of the earth and sunk its “bases”.  
 
The creation angel is sculpted in wool.  The vibrant graduating colour of earth, sea and sky in the crocheted backdrop landscape reflects the intricate design and detailed beauty of God’s creation.

We reflect here on God the artist and Master Designer.  His awesome power created not only the heavens and the earth, and the angelic host, but also fashioned and crafted us.  God knit us together in our mother's womb.  We are “fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14), each of us uniquely hand crafted by God.
