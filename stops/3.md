### Background

The Hebrew word for angel is ‘mal’ak’ meaning representative, while the Greek word for angel is ‘angelos’ meaning messenger.  

The Bible confirms the role of angels as that of God’s agents, bringing His messages of hope, comfort, protection and assurance. These angels operate as God’s servants to guide, guard and protect us. They carry out God’s kingdom assignments and they follow His instruction.  

“Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?” (Hebrews 1:14)

Above all, the role of angels is to reflect God’s glory.  Their purpose in their actions, in their service and in their praise is to turn our eyes to God.  The Bible is clear that angels should not be worshipped or prayed to.  When John tried to bow to an angel, he was told, 

“You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you”. (Revelation 22:9)

Looking upwards to heaven, the servant angel expectantly awaits instruction from God. The intricate, mirrored mosaic pieces, fashioned together in the wing backdrop, point us upwards to celebrate God’s glory.
