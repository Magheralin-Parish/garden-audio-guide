### Background

In the wilderness for 40 days, Jesus was challenged on all sides – physically, emotionally and spiritually.  Throughout this time, He speaks God’s truth and holds to His Father’s promises.  After he refutes the devil and claims the victory, angels have the enormous privilege of attending and ministering to Him.

“Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.” (Matthew 4:11)

The forty individually handmade ceramic angels remind us of our own fragility and frailty as we face difficulty and testing.  The purity of the cream angels emphasises that, through Jesus, we can be made whole and clean in His sight.  

The angels are crafted in clay and fired at high temperatures to fix their shape and remove impurities.  The process is akin to what we read in Isaiah 48:10 of being “tested in the furnace of affliction”.  They are positioned on fabric; the word ‘forty’ written in Ancient Greek is printed in repeat pattern.
