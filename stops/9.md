### Background

Elijah is overwhelmed. He is without hope, broken and wants to die.  Threatened by Jezebel, as we are told in 1 Kings 19, the prophet is on the run, frightened and feeling lost. God sees Elijah’s needs and responds to him by sending an angel to offer him food, nourishment and sustenance.  

“…And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, ‘Arise and eat.’” (1 Kings 19:5)

Sometimes life breaks us.  The mosaic angel and wings, tailored together with fragments of cups and saucers, reflects the restorative, repairing and healing heart of God. It is a reminder that God can take the broken pieces of our lives, our shattered spirits and our damaged hearts and that He can repair them. He is the God of restoration. As He sustained Elijah, so He will sustain us, with enough strength and encouragement to continue His journey.

 “For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the Lord…” (Jeremiah 30:17)
