#### *Featuring an interview with Zara Haw*

### Background

The resurrection angels announce the greatest event in history.
 
“He is not here, He is risen!” (Mark 16:6)

This is hope: “Because I live, you also will live”. (John 14:19)

The angel or angels at the empty tomb are described in different ways in the Gospels.  “His appearance was like lightening and his clothing white as snow” (Matthew 28:3).  We are also told they are “dressed in a white robe” or “dazzling apparel”.

In this exhibit, the slender stone-effect angels stand tall and unassuming, deflecting attention from themselves and pointing us to the miraculous resurrection of Jesus.  The stone-effect backdrop signifies the empty tomb; the stone is rolled away.  The focus is no longer the tomb, nor the folded grave clothes.  Nor are we invited to focus on the messenger angels, but on the risen Jesus and living Christ.
