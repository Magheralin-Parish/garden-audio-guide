### Background

Jesus is isolated and alone in the Garden of Gethsemane. In the midst of the agony, solitude and turmoil of this garden scene, and just moments before His betrayal, Jesus draws close to His heavenly Father and prays. God sends an angel to stand with Jesus in His pain.  

“And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.  And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” (Luke 22:43-33)

A single angel head stands against the darkness and isolation.   It is fashioned in wax and gold leaf.  The layers of gold leaf within the surface of the angel head are symbolic of the God of strength.

In our lives when faced with overwhelming difficulties and turmoil, God promises to give us the strength, mercy and grace that we require in our time of need. 

“Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” (Isaiah 41:10)
