### Background

Peter is in prison awaiting his execution.  Sleeping in his cell, he lies guarded by soldiers, and bound with chains.  A bright light in the cell announces the angel’s appearance.  Peter’s chains fall off and the cell doors are unlocked.

This angel sculpted in metal with keys, chains and locks is created by prisoners of HMP Maghaberry. While the Bible describes many angel accounts of physical chain breaking and freedom from prison, the overall story of the Bible tells of Jesus breaking the spiritual chains that hold us.  

‘Chains’ and ‘prisons’ hold us captive in so many ways in our daily lives; prisons of addiction, depression, anxiety, shame, and rejection.  Ultimately, we are chained by sin.  Whatever prison situation we face, or whatever chains bind us, Jesus is the answer to our freedom.  

Jesus is the key to unlock our prison doors, to release our chains.  If we believe in Him, He gives us the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven.

“So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.” (John 8:36)
