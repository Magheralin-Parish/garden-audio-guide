### Background

“And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven”. (Mark 13:27)

Jesus tells us of a harvest of salvation and He points us to a time when we will all stand before Him in judgement.  The Bible says the angels will gather everyone who ever lived and separate those who know and love Him from those who have turned their backs on God. 

“The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels”.  (Matthew 13:39)

The willow Angel stands tall, imposing and resolute.  His role is a sobering one.  While the possibility of separation from God is terrifying, Jesus paints a picture of strong harvest angels.  They stand with open arms ready to gather and receive us into God’s Kingdom.  Jesus wants to bring us into His heavenly storehouse and into the Kingdom of God.
