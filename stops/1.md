### Background

Down through the centuries, artists, poets and song writers have attempted to portray their interpretations of angels. Modern culture is fascinated by the subject, with the contemporary view of an angel being that of a white feathered female form or, perhaps, a chubby baby.

The Bible, however, often describes angels very differently to what we see depicted in the arts.  Psalm 103:20 refers to angels as “mighty ones”.

CS Lewis reminds us that they are powerful warriors and mighty agents of God:

“In scripture the visitation of an angel is always alarming; it has to begin by saying, ‘Fear not’”.  (Preface, Screwtape Letters.)

The magnificent white-feathered angel links our perception of angels with those described in the Bible.  There is peace, beauty, and purity in the white-feathered angel.  The wings become a symbol for swiftness and action.  The gender is less important – in the Bible, angels take on the form of a man or are like a man.  

The feathered angel seeks to expand our understanding, challenge our perceptions and increase our imagination.
