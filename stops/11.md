### Background

Elisha and his servant are surrounded by a Syrian army.  Yet while Elisha sees God’s protection of God’s awesome army of angels, the servant despairs as he can only see what is physical. Elisha reassures him:
 
“Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” (2 Kings 6:16)
 
Elisha prays for God to open his servant’s eyes, and he looks again to see that “the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around”. (2 Kings 6:17)

Our exhibit is reminiscent of God’s army of angels, poised, equipped and ready for battle in brilliant bright and shining armour.  Look again; the chariot is in position, and the metal background flames signify that the battle has already commenced.  
 
We live in a physical and earthly realm. If we had eyes to see, we would witness a spiritual realm occupied by angels. Protection is all around us no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in. Psalm 34:7 reminds us that, 

“The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him and delivers them”.
