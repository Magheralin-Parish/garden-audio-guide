### Background

Archangel Michael is formidable, ‘a mighty warrior’ and ‘leader of other angels’. 
 
Through the death and resurrection of Jesus, the eternal victory has been won, but the spiritual battle still continues. To stand firm against the spiritual forces of evil, God instructs us to put on the full spiritual armour of God; the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit.   
 
The warrior angel is in full suit of armour, intimidating, fierce, strong; equipped and ready for battle.  The painted backdrop reflects the battle between good and evil, between light and darkness.  The gold effect reminds us that, even as the battle continues, the victory has been won and the victory belongs to God.
 
It is Jesus who fights our battles today.  He “goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory” (Deuteronomy 20:4).  His angels still act as our protectors, but they submit to the authority, power and majesty of the risen Christ.
