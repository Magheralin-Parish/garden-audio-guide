### Background

The ticking hands of the Clock Angel remind us that for the angels, as for us, there is a time for everything.

For God’s holy angels, they are looking forward to the time when they will accompany Jesus’ return in glory.

“But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.” (Matthew 24:36)

For those who have faith, we are told the time will come when God will dispatch his angels to carry us to our eternal destination.  Lazarus’ story is written in Luke 16:22:

“The poor man died and was carried by the angels” (…to heaven).

This is an image of God’s people, not accompanied or escorted, but honoured by angels and lovingly carried to Jesus’ side.

God is sovereign over time; He rules over all things past, all things present and all things future. His timing and His ways are perfect.  The Clock Angel reminds us that every second, every minute and every hour of our lives brings us closer to the God of Ages.
