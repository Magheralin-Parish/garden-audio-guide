### Background

Hagar flees to the desert. She is alone, abandoned and desperate.  Seeing her desperation, God sends an angel to comfort her, to give her hope and to rescue her.  Marvelling that God sees her, Hagar is the first in the Bible to name God and calls Him “The God who sees me”.

In Psalm 17:8, David too recognises the significance of remaining at the centre of God’s focus, attention and love. “Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings.” 

The angel wings in this exhibit, created from peacock feathers, remind us that God sees us – that His gaze on us is constant as He looks into our lives and our hearts.
  
Whatever desert we find ourselves in today, whatever circumstances seek to overwhelm us, God offers us protection and rest in the shadow of His beautiful wings. As He focuses on us, He asks us to keep our eyes fixed on Him, with the promise that “in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us” (Romans 8:37).
