>One expression of His goodness is His
mercy. He shows forgiveness and
forgives our very worst sins and
selfishness. He shows mercy when
others don’t. Jesus the Good Shepherd
cares about us so much He laid down His
life for us on the Cross. He couldn’t care
more and His mercy opens
for us a door into His house
where we will live with Him
forever, Hallelujah!!
