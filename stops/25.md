### Background

Heaven is depicted in many ways in the Bible.  Revelation 21 describes heaven as a place where there is no sorrow, pain or mourning and where God “will wipe away every tear from their eyes” (Revelation 21:4).  

Scripture tells us that heaven is a new place of perfect peace, where all who know and love God “cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God”. (Luke 30:36)

John received a ‘vision’ or picture of heaven as God’s throne room: “and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal”(Revelation4:6).  John describes angels around the throne, four living creatures each with six wings worshipping and declaring God’s nature and character.

The Throne Room Angel reflects the crystal sapphire sea of the vast heavenly ocean surrounding God.  The six glass wings radiate the angels’ endless refrain: 

“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!”  (Revelation 4:8)

John declares that heaven is the Kingdom of God.  The throne is not empty.  It is occupied by the Lord God Almighty.
