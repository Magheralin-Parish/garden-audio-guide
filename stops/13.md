### Background

Gabriel is the chief ‘good news’ messenger of God. 

“I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.” (Luke 1:19)

In one of the most famous narratives in history, Gabriel enters Mary’s world.  He sits beside her, calls her ‘the favoured one’ and brings the news of a miracle for which the whole world has been waiting.
 
Mary’s heart is prepared for Gabriel’s visitation and God’s promises. 

 “I am willing to be used of the Lord. Let it happen to me as you have said.” (Luke 1:38)
 
As we gaze on Gabriel and his intricately woven silk wings, we are called to imagine the comfort he provides to quench the trepidation of the young Mary.  

Gabriel comes softly, gently and soothingly to Mary, whispering God’s promises to her heart.  The subtle colour palette reflects the humility both Gabriel and Mary display in this angelic encounter.  The intricate threads of the smocked wings speak of patience, commitment and design.   The threads of God’s promises to us are woven throughout the Bible.
