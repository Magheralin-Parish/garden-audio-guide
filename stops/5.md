### Background

It is in the Garden of Eden that Adam and Eve disobey God.  The consequences of their sin are a life of eternal pain. In mercy, God removes them from the Garden of Eden and assigns the Cherubim to bar their way back in.
 
The angel gate is a reminder of the Cherubim, stationed at the East Gate of Eden. He stands with sword in hand, powerful and steadfast, separating us from the richness, beauty and perfection of the Garden of Eden.
 
The Bible tells us that almost a third of angels rebelled against God and chose their own way. These fallen angels are now forever banished from heaven. Our separation and our rebellion against God, however, is not for eternity.  

The Cherubim guards the gate until an appointed time when God returns, and he will put down his sword and welcome God’s people back into a new Eden. Jesus is the key through which we can find a way back into Eden and the tree of life.
