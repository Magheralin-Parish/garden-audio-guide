> God has prepared a banquet
for those who are His.
Today God says,
“Look to me!
Come walk on the path of
peace. Focus on Me! Trust in Me! I am all
you need. My table is prepared for you,
please eat from it. My purposes are the
best and I have anointed you with the oil
of my Holy Spirit. My love for you is ever-
flowing and overflowing! I am with you!”
