### Background

Prayerful and faithful Daniel is thrown into the lion’s den where, even in the face of danger, his devotion to God is unwavering. God intervenes on his behalf and sends an angel to deliver and protect Daniel.   The strength and power of the lions is nothing compared to the delivering and rescuing power of God. 

“My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths…” (Daniel 6:22)

The dramatic, animal-like angel stands strong and unafraid against the danger of the lions. The stone-cave effect of the backdrop encompasses the angel in the den.  But God’s cloak of deliverance and protection is stronger, more powerful and mightier than any den of lions.  

 Psalm 34:17 tells us,

 “When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles.”

While we may not be faced with a den of lions, we may be caught and trapped by a different kind of den, a den of fear... a den of doubt... a den of pain. For those who are faithful to God, He will protect us and deliver us from harm.
