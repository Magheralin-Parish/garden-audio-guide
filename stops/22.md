### Background

Though we don’t often see them, hear them or feel them, our lives are surrounded by angels.  They have much more to do with us than we recognise or understand. 

Contrary to popular belief, the Bible does not confirm that we have our own individual guardian angel.  We may have multiple angels protecting us at different times of our lives! 

“See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.” (Matthew 18:10)

At times we all feel small and need to see God’s arms reaching out and stretching around us, encompassing us and encircling us.  Sometimes God does this through prayer, through people we encounter or through an angel. 

Angels assist us because God commands them to.  When they minister to us, it is because God has directed them.  And when an angel is dispatched to our aid, God has determined it.     

“He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways”.  (Psalm 91:11)
