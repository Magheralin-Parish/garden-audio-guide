### Background

In one of the most well-known passages from the Old Testament, we read that God gives Jacob a vision of angels, ascending and descending, on a ladder that links earth to heaven.  The ladder in Jacob’s dream is a representation of the connection between heaven and earth. 

“And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!” (Genesis 28:12)

The ladder angel very visually reminds us of Jacob’s dream.  However, its crafted wood also points us to the wood of the cross since, in the New Testament, Jesus tells us that He has made the ladder redundant: 

“Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”  (John 1:51)

It is Jesus alone who connects heaven and earth, and the angels are now ascending and descending on Him. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life and, through His sacrifice, our eyes are drawn to heaven, to eternal life and to God.
