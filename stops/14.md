### Background

God’s guiding hand is upon Joseph, the humble carpenter.  In three separate dreams, angels reveal Mary’s conception, warn Joseph to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus, and finally instruct him to return to Nazareth.
  
The seamless way in which the three angels communicate with Joseph is reflected in the smoothness of the wooden sculpture, and its curves. While the wood angel is quite abstract, we can sense the gentleness with which the angel deals with Joseph.  The care and guidance which God has for Joseph is full and complete, constantly meeting Joseph where he is and at his moment of need! 
 
We too have the assurance of God’s guidance in our own lives. Just as Joseph was obedient to the angel’s message, we too need to be faithful to follow God’s instruction. 

“I will bless the Lord who has counselled me; indeed, my mind instructs me in the night. I have set the Lord continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.” (Psalm 16:7-8)
